# NodeMart: Your One-Stop Shop for Online Commerce

## Team
### Team Members:
- Kirubel
- Haven

### Roles:
- Kirubel: Backend Developer
- Haven: Frontend Developer

### Justification:
- Kirubel, with experience in backend development, will handle server-side logic, database management, and API integrations.
- Haven, being proficient in frontend technologies, will focus on crafting user interfaces, client-side interactions, and ensuring an intuitive user experience.

The roles were assigned based on the team members' respective strengths and expertise, ensuring efficient division of labor and smoother project execution.

## Technologies
### Languages:
- JavaScript (Node.js, React)
- HTML/CSS

### Frameworks:
- Express.js (Node.js backend)
- React.js (Frontend)

### Database:
- MongoDB

### API:
- RESTful API

### Other Options Considered:
- For the frontend, an alternative to React.js could have been Angular or Vue.js. The decision to use React.js was based on its popularity, extensive community support, and its component-based architecture, which facilitates reusability and maintainability.
- Instead of MongoDB, a relational database like PostgreSQL could have been chosen. However, MongoDB was preferred due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and ease of integration with Node.js.

## Challenge
### Problem:
NodeMart aims to provide a seamless e-commerce experience, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase products online efficiently.

### What it Will Not Solve:
NodeMart will not address logistical challenges such as shipping and inventory management, which are typically handled by separate systems.

### Target Users:
NodeMart will benefit both buyers and sellers, providing a platform for businesses to reach a wider audience and for consumers to access a diverse range of products conveniently.

### Locale Dependency:
The project is not dependent on a specific locale and can be accessed globally.

## Risks
### Technical Risks:
- Integration issues between frontend and backend components
- Performance bottlenecks under high user load
- Data security vulnerabilities
To mitigate these risks, regular code reviews, testing, and implementing security best practices are essential.

### Non-Technical Risks:
- Changes in market demand or user preferences
- Legal and regulatory compliance issues
Regular market research and staying informed about industry trends can help mitigate non-technical risks.

## Infrastructure
### Branching and Merging:
We will follow the Gitflow branching model, utilizing feature branches for development and merging them into the main branch via pull requests after code review.

### Deployment Strategy:
Continuous deployment using CI/CD pipelines, deploying updates to a staging environment for testing before promoting them to production.

### Data Population:
Initially, we'll populate the app with sample data manually. Later, we'll integrate with external APIs or utilize scraping tools for real-time data updates.

### Testing Tools:
We'll use Jest and Enzyme for unit testing React components, Supertest for API testing, and Selenium for end-to-end testing.

## Existing Solutions
### Similar Products:
- Amazon
- eBay
- Shopify

### Similarities:

- Offer search, browsing, and purchasing functionalities.

### Differences:
- NodeMart aims to differentiate by focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and personalized recommendations.
- It will offer unique features tailored to both buyers and sellers, enhancing the overall user experience.

NodeMart intends to reimplement certain features from existing solutions while introducing novel elements to distinguish itself in the market.
